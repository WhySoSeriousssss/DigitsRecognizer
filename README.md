# DigitsRecognizer
a long-term deep learning project. developing while learning

Iteration #1
  3-layer neural network (10-5-10)
  relu activation for the first 2 layers, softmax activation for the last layer
  no regulization, no everything
  30,000 training examples (had a memory error with 60k examples)
  training accuracy 93%, testing accuracy 90%
